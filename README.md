# Goal
Easy-bank allows to scrape data from obk (c src for more details) ebanking extracting transaction data.
Data is stored at a db ep of choice. See my pre-config db api: https://github.com/zenith0/easyb-api/  
While scraping a web dashboard is opened showing statistics: https://github.com/zenith0/easyb-ui/
